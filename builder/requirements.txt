# Builder dependencies (used only during Docker build)
# These are needed to pre-download models

# Note: torch, torchaudio, and openai-whisper are already installed
# in the previous Dockerfile layer, so we don't need to list them here.
# This file exists for consistency with builder pattern and future extensions.
